# CSCI 23000 - Computing I, Summer 2022

The context of computing in history and society, information representation in digital computers, introduction to programming in a modern high-level language, introduction to algorithm and data structures, and their implementation as programs.

## Body Mass Index (BMI)
Demonstrate your ability to create a graphic user interface in Python using HTML and CSS. Create a simple web server with Bottle. Build a web application that prompts the user for his or her height and weight, and sends that data to another page, which calculates the BMI as well as some feedback.

## Card Game
The objective of this lab is to create the beginnings for a python-based card game. We DO NOT expect a fully functioning card game. What we do expect is that you create a main function and various functions that will accomplish the following goals:

Build a single-dimension array to keep track of the location of every card
DO NOT move cards around... Just use the array to keep track of where each card is
All card data is really integers - Use other arrays to translate integers to suits, ranks, and player names
All cards will start in the DECK
Write a function that translates a card number to a card name. HINT - look at the suitName and rankName arrays
Write a function to assign a card to a given player
Dealing a card involves picking a card number and assigning a new location to the corresponding element of cardLoc
Write a function that displays the location of every card. (Early versions should show numeric values for the card number and location. Later versions can include string values for prettier output.)
Write a function that prints the name of every card in a given hand

## Change Maker
Create a program that calculates change after a purchase. This will be a sequential algorithm, which is one of the simplest programming patterns. Your solution requires no branching or looping. Simply write a series of statements that will execute in order.

## Cryptography
Create a program that assists in a basic form of cryptography, a substitution cypher. Write a program that will accept a phrase and convert it into code by substituting letters according to a key.

This program will also be an example of functions. You will be given a main function body. This function refers to a number of other functions which you will have to create. It's part of your job to figure out how these functions should be created and what their parameters and output should be.

The program is based on a standard text-based menu. You'll need to create methods (function) to display the menu, get input from it, and handle the details. Your program should encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Final Project 
Create a project that demonstrates your mastery of CS concepts. Plan the project, document it, build it, and demonstrate its use

Pick any topic of interest to you. If you are having trouble thinking of a topic, ask on the forums or drop me an email. Let me know what you're thinking of working on, and I'll help you get in the right direction. As a minimum, your program should:

Be programmed in Python
Use some type of data structure (array, objects, files, database)
Incorporate some sort of user Interface (Tkinter, pygame, command - line menu)
Solve some identified problem
Run without crashing under typical load
Illustrate programming knowledge
Be original work

## High Low
Create a program that illustrates your understanding of conditions. Create a "High-Low" game which allows the user to play a game with the computer. The game will require input, output, branching and loop behaviors.

## Knock Knock
Create a version of the famous "Hello World" project - with a twist. Write a program that asks the user's name, greets the user by name, and tells a knock-knock joke.

## Machine Language
Learn how basic hardware and architecture works. Experiment with a simple machine language simulator. Build a successively more complex series of programs in machine and assembly language.
