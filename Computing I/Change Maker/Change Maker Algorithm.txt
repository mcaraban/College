Overview: 
The program should ask for a purchase price and the amount of cash tendered.
It should then determine how many coins or bills of the following denominations
should be returned: 
penny
$0.01
nickel
$0.05
dime
$0.10
quarter
$0.25
dollar
$1.00
five
$5.00
ten
$10.00
twenty
$20.00

Input:
Inputs would include the price of an item and amount of cash avaliable.Both of these
inputs would be float types due to currency having two decimal points

Output:
Outputs would be the change and amount of bills and/or coins. The change is needed to 
determine the bills and/or coins. A successful run would determine the correct amount of
change and then using the correct amount of change determine the correct amount of bills and/or
coins.

Procedure:
Create a variable called Price of float type that asks the user the "Price of the Item" and stores the result
Create a variable called Cash of float type that asks the user "Cash Tendered" and stores the result
Create a variable called Change of float type rounded to two decimal points to determine the Change 
by taking the Cash variable minus the Price variable
Print Change and its value
Multiple Change variable by 100 to convert to pennies and store it in Change variable
Print Change in pennies and its value
Print Twenties and value of Change divided by 2000 rounded to near integer (2000 pennies = $20)
Store the remainder of the quotient in Change variable using mod operator
Print Tens and value of Change divided by 1000 rounded to near integer (1000 pennies = $10)
Store the remainder of the quotient in Change variable using mod operator
Print Fives and value of Change divided by 500 rounded to near integer (500 pennies = $5)
Store the remainder of the quotient in Change variable using mod operator
Print Ones and value of Change divided by 100 rounded to near integer (100 pennies = $1)
Store the remainder of the quotient in Change variable using mod operator
Print Quarters and value of Change divided by 25 rounded to near integer (25 pennies = 1 quarter)
Store the remainder of the quotient in Change variable using mod operator
Print Dimes and value of Change divided by 10 rounded to near integer (10 pennies = 1 dime)
Store the remainder of the quotient in Change variable using mod operator
Print Nickles and value of Change divided by 5 rounded to near integer (5 pennies = 1 nickle)
Store the remainder of the quotient in Change variable using mod operator
Print Pennies and value of Change
