# Final Project 

## Overview
Create a system with capital quizzes from each continent/region. A user will be able to pick which continent they would like a quiz from.
The quizzes will be 10 questions long which will include the 10 most populous countries from the continent/region. After the quiz, 
the user will receive their result and given the option to return back to menu to select another quiz if theyâ€™d like. Once completed, 
create a GUI for the quizzes making them multiple choice.
