Overview:
Create a graphic user interface in Python using HTML and CSS. Create a simple web server with Bottle. Build a web application which prompts
the user for his or her height and weight, sends that data to another page, which calculates the BMI as well as some feedback based off the 
matching status.

Input:
The inputs for this program will be the height and weight. The information will get imported from another page where it is initially asked. 
It will be changed into floating type to include decimal places and rounded to two places.

Output:
The program will produce a users BMI from the given height and weight. Based off the BMI calculated, it will also produce a users status.
A successful status will successfully produce these calculations and results. Something going wrong can come in the form of incorrectly calculating 
the BMI. Other examples would be the BMI being calculated correctly but not providing the correct status.

Procedure:
Create a variable called feet with value imported from bottle
Create a variable called inches with value imported from bottle
Create a variable called pounds with value imported from bottle
Create a variable called height with value of float converted feet variable times twelve plus float converted inches variable
Convert pounds to float type
Create a variable called BMI with value of the BMI formula with out data
Round BMI variable to two decimals
If BMI is less than or equal to 18.5,
Create a variable called Status with value underweight
If BMI is less than or equal to 24.9,
Create a variable called Status with value normal
If BMI is less than or equal to 29.9,
Create a variable called Status with value overweight
Else
Create a variable called Status with value obese
