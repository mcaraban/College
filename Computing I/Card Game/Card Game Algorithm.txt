Overview:
The objective of this lab is to create the beginnings for a python-based card game.A fully functioning card game is not expected. What is expected is to create 
a main function and various functions that will  accomplish certain goals. The functions should keep track of the location of every card. All cards will start
in the deck. Translate intergers to suits, ranks and player names. Write a function to assign a card to a given player. Write a function that displays the location 
of every card. Write a function that prints the name of every card in a given hand

Input:
No inputs?

Output:
The program will produce location of all the cards, whether in the deck,player or computer. It will also display/produce the five cards the player and computer have 
been dealt. A successful run will be able to display all of the latter. If something goes wrong, it could be in the form of not showing all the cards a player and/or
a computer has, repeating cards, or cards not being dealt.

Procedure:
Create a function called clearDeck() with no parameters 
Begin with sentry(cardNum) at 0 and add 1 to sentry on each pass until sentry is equal to 51 
(code to repeat)
Assign card to deck

Create a function called showDeck() with no parameters
output the text " Location of all cards    #     card    location"
Begin with sentry(cardNum) at 0 and add 1 to sentry on each pass until sentry is equal to 51
(code to repeat)
Create a variable called position with value of card location at position of the sentry
Create a varibable called hand with the value of playerName array at position of the position variable
Create a variable called cardName with value of function called getCardName with parameter of card number
output the values of the sentry, cardName, and hand
(End)
output all

Create a function called getCardName passing the values of card number
Create a variable called suit with value of card number divided by 13 using integer division
Create a variable called rank with value of card number mod 13
Create a variable called cardName with the output of the value of rankname array at position rank and the value of suitname array at position suit
return the value of cardName

Create a function called assignCard passing the values of hand
Create a variable called cardNum with a value of random integer between 0-51
Initialize sentry with variable named KeepGoing as true then continue loop as long as condition is true. 
(code to repeat)
Create a variable called cardNum with a value of random integer between 0-51
if card location is in the deck set condition variable to false
(End)
Assign that card to the hand

Create a function called showHand passing the values of hand
Output the text "Displaying playerName hand" with the value of playerName
Begin with sentry(cardNum) at 0 and add 1 to sentry on each pass until sentry is equal to 51 
(code to repeat)
if card is in hand output the value of card (getCardName function)
(End)
output all
