Overview:
The game begins with the computer generating a random integer between 1 and 100.
The user will guess a number, and the computer will indicate whether the guess
is too high, too low, or correct. This will continue until the user has correctly
guessed the computer's number.

Input:
Input would include each time a number guess is performed. In this game, the input 
will need to be an integer. The input will be retreived by asking the user for a number 
multiple times.

Output:
The program will produce a random integer from 1 to 100. Once the input is taken, the 
program will produce an answer of too high, too low, or correct depening on the input 
compared to the random integer. The program will also produce the amound of tries it 
took to achieve the correct number. A successful run will allow the user to correctly 
guess the number. Unsuccessful runs would end in the user not being able to guess the
number or an endless loop.

Procedue:
Print the instructions of the game (I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100 
Guess a number, and I'll tell you if you're too high, too low, or got it right.
Good luck!)
Generate a random integer from 1 to 100 and store it into GeneratedNumber
Create variable named Tries  with initial value of 0
Initialize sentry with variable named KeepGoing as true then continue loop as long as condition is true. 
Inside loop, change sentry KeepGoing with False after Guess variable 
equals GeneratedNumber.
Code that is repeated is the following,
Add an integer to Tries everytime loop is ran and store it in Tries
Ask the user "Please enter an integer:" and store in Guess
Convert Guess variable to integer and store in Guess
If Guess is larger than GeneratedNumber then print "Too High"
If Guess is smaller than GeneratedNumber then print "Too Low"
If Guess equals GeneratedNumber then print "Correct" with amount of Tries
