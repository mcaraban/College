# STAT 35000 – Introduction to Statistics, Fall 2021

A data-oriented introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of applied statistics. The objective is to acquaint the students with the essential ideas and methods of statistical analysis for data in simple settings. In this class, students will develop both theoretical 
and practical skills. Topics include: basic real data analysis using R; basic probability theory; random variables; Normal distribution; 
law of large numbers; Central Limit Theorem; statistical estimation; condence intervals; hypothesis testing; simple linear regression; analysis of variance (ANOVA).

## Project 1 
The objective of this introductory project is to get acquainted with the basic features of Rstudio (or R).

## Project 2
You will now use R to generate (simulate), the sampling distribution of the statistic nx (the sample average) when sampling from the Exponential distribution. • Generate 10000M=different random samples, each with 16n= observations, from the Exponential distribution, (0.1)XExpλ=, which has mean 10μ= and a standard deviation 10σ;
