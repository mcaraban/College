# STAT-I 417 – Statistical Theory
An introduction to the mathematical theory of statistical inference, emphasizing inference for standard parametric families of distributions. Properties of estimators. Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation. Sufficient statistics. Properties of test of hypotheses. Most powerful and likelihood-ratio tests. Distribution theory for common statistics based on normal distributions.

## Project 1
The objective of this introductory project is to get acquainted with the basic features of Rstudio (or R).

## Project 2
• Graph and nicely labeled (on a single figure) the density curves of the Norm(μ, σ2) and the Gamma(a =
μ/2, b = 2) with μ = 70. Do they appear to be similar?
• Use the previous parts to calculate the actual coverage probabilities when the data is generated from
the Gamma(a = μ/2, b = 2) distribution, and study how the coverage probabilities are impacted by
changing the sample size n as you complete the table below. Also, include a copy of your code (just for
one choice of n).
• How would you explain the impact of the increased sample size on the coverage probability and the
“observed Confidence Level” as compared to the “Desired Confidence Level”

## Project 3
