# STAT 42100 â€“ Modern Statistical Modeling Using R and SAS, Fall 2022


## Description
The course demonstrates how computing can be used to understand the
performance of core statistical methods and introduces modern statistical methods that require
computing in their applications. We mainly cover relevant fundamentals for two statistical
programming languages, SAS and R.
A. R Statistical Software: R environment and syntax, data structure including vectors, ma-
trices, arrays, data frames, and lists, basic vocabulary, conditional execution, functions,
using R packages, looping, graphics with ggplot2, data cleaning with dplyr, random sam-
pling, probability distributions in R, t-test, ANOVA, and regression in R.
B. SAS Statistical Software: SAS interface and syntax, DATA steps including inputting data,
processing of variables, modifying and combination of data sets, operators, functions,
PROC steps including sorting, printing and summarizing, if-then-else, do loop, ODS,
macros, categorical analysis, t-test, ANOVA, correlation and regression in SAS.
C. Introduction to Computational Methods and Statistical Modeling: Simulation Studies,
Permutation Test, Bootstrapping, Logistic Regression, High Dimensional Linear Regres-
sion with LASSO and Ridge penalty, and Nonparametric Smoothing. If time permits,
machine learning/deep learning methods will be discussed.
Students completing this course will be able to use SAS and R to read and write data, to
perform descriptive analyses, to graphically display data distributions, to perform statistical
analysis such as chi-square test, t-test, ANOVA, regression as well as some modern statistical
methods. Students will be able to optimize uni-variable and multi-variable functions using
user-dened and build-in functions, to use numerical method to nd MLE, to simulate random
variables, and to implement various modern statistical

## Final Project 
For the project, you will use R/SAS to answer questions about the data of Australian athlete data set (AIS). Answer all questions using R/SAS. (See Final Project document)
