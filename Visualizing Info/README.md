# NEWM-N 328 â€“ Visualizing Information, Spring 2023

Exploration of techniques for using graphics and sound to present data and information. Topics include data types (including data that is geographical and/or time-varying), presentation techniques, effective use of design elements, and effective use of interaction methods.

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, you will design and produce a static visualization for a small dataset. You will also produce a short write-up (no longer than 1 page) to document your design process, provide rigorous justification for your design choices, and explain your findings (that is, what insights have you discovered about the dataset from analyzing the visualization). You are free to use any visualization or charting tool to produce your visualization. You are also free to manually create the visualization, either digitally on a computer, or on paper (using pencils, Crayola pens, etc...). However, your visualization will be evaluated using the same quality standards, regardless of the tools and medium you end up using.

## Assignment 2
In this assignment, your goal is to perform an exploratory visual analysis of a dataset of your choice. Here are some sample datasets for you to choose from. However, you're also free to look for a different dataset that you personally find interesting. Your objective is to conduct a broad exploratory visual analysis of the dataset; posing a series of questions, and generating visualizations to answer those questions. Your goal is to analyze the resulting visualizations, and iteratively spawn follow-up questions. As you iterate, keep track of your questions, take screenshots of the visualizations you generate, and include those in a "notebook" to illustrate your exploration activity.

## Assignment 3
The goal of this assignment is to give you formal experience in critiquing and evaluating visualization. You will select a visualization, produce a written critique of the visualization.

## Final Project
The goal of the final project is to give you hands-on experience in designing and implementing interactive visualizations using D3. We will learn how to import data, parse it, and clean it up using JavaScript. We'll then visualize this data using common charts: bar charts, line charts, scatterplots, etc... Your task is to design and implement an interactive visualization in D3 to facilitate the exploration of your chosen dataset.
