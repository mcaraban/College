# MATH 49200 – Capstone Experience, Spring 2023
Faculty directed or approved independent reading and/or research to satisfy the capstone requirement

## Description
I will be discussing the numerical solution for a partial differential equation, specifically, I will discuss the method used to solve the equation, its order, and how the order is calculated using MATLAB. 

## Task
Solve the following initial value problem of the following differential equation ut + uux = 0 in the region R = {(x, t)|0 ≤ t, 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π}. The initial condition is u(x, 0) = 2.5 + sin(x). Assume perioid boundary condtion: u(2π, t) = u(0, t). Use the upwind scheme. Run your code on a series of at least 6 pairs of gradually halved (△x,△t). Compute the solution up to t=1. Plot the solutions on the x−u plane for t = 1 on the same figure and compute the order of accuracy p in both space and time.
